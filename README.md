# xkodegen

# A package that auto generate code for you.
> The idea is to have consistent standards across the organization while creating components. So, when you create you database tables, classes, and interfaces you don't rely on the developers to follow the standards. The cli would allow you to provide the config in a json and implement the standards.

### How to install 
``` npm i -g xkodegen ```

The only supported command right now is:
``` xgen -n "anyname" ```
This should display the entered name in a box.
